     “I haven’t changed my mind about modernism from the first
     day I ever did it…. It means integrity; it means honesty; it
     means the absence of sentimentality and the absence of
     nostalgia; it means simplicity; it means clarity. That’s
     what modernism means to me…”

   Paul Rand

   WHO
   WAS
   PAUL
   RAND?

   Paul Rand, formerly Peretz Rosenbaum, is a self made designer
   and art director whom attended Harren High School during his
   teenage years, was a professor at Yale University and designed
   the ABC, IBM, NeXT and various other logos. He was mostly self
   taught through his own experience and ambition but during his
   years at High School he did take night classes to further
   progress himself. Rand’s origins can be traced back to the city
   of New York, where he was born during the year 1914. Even as a
   toddler Rand seemed to be well suited to art and visual design
   where he was able to express himself creatively.

   He did not begin down this career path reinvent graphics
   design, but instead wanted to be the best graphics designer
   there was. When he first entered High School he found the other
   students were intent on getting jobs that would net them a
   solid wage. Rand at the time was told by his father that making
   art was no way to make money. Despite this, he found some
   success in the field, as he managed to gain two High School
   diplomas. Despite being proud of his position and
   qualifications, he found school didn’t satisfy himself
   creatively. So he then went onto find work beyond education.

   With this he decided to change his image. Even his own name
   changed, with his original name Peretz Rosenbaum and then
   deciding to change it to “Paul Rand” - a far more recognizable
   and American name. Something he saw as necessary to progress
   himself as a brand and creative in the industry.

   One of his first jobs and the start of his long lasting
   successful career began with the creation of stock images for
   various different types of media, like magazines and
   newspapers. He was given the work by some some well known media
   names at the time such as Direction and Esquire. Both of which
   are still published to this day and are magazines. Sometimes
   Rand even worked for free, just to get his name out there and
   to saturate his growing portfolio. When Rand was in his mid
   twenties, one of the leading arts magazines in America called
   Paul Rand one of the “most promising young influences on
   American graphics design”.

   Following this, one day he received a call from by a company
   called William H Wientruab. They gave him the opportunity to
   work with a big name copywriter Bill Bernbach and they would
   collaborate together and create for the company. Rand accepted
   this position and with Bill’s help Rand created adverts, with a
   minimal aesthetic and contained a strong and powerful message.

   Rand said during this time that his first meeting with Bill
   Bernbach was “akin to Columbus discovering America,” and goes
   on to say, “This was my first encounter with a copywriter who
   understood visual ideas and who didn’t come in with a yellow
   copy pad and a preconceived notion of what the layout should
   look like.” Rand spent a total of 14 years in the company
   working for clients like, Airwick, Schenley and El Producto
   Cigars. In his later work his inspiration can be clearly seen
   coming from his work and experience at William H Wientruab.

   THE
   WORKS

   Rand’s name was out, his brand was being talked about. He soon
   got the attention of big corporations, like IBM. IBM at this
   time was at the forefront of computing and technology and is
   still very relevant today. With this he was able to put
   together the final IBM logo, but not by himself. In the
   beginning, IBM created a team of top designers and thinkers,
   with Eero Saarinen leading the charge, he was considered at the
   time the godfather of modernism and co-creator the final logo.

   Charles and Ray Eames, two architectural and modernist
   designers and filmmakers. Their works include Day Of The Dead,
   St. Mary’s Catholic Church and various exhibitions, one of
   which was featured in the Library of Congress. Finally the last
   member of the team - Isamu Noguchi, a long time professional
   sculptor. Whom has had his work featured in various high level
   museums and art galleries. Together they represented the
   pinnacle of modern design and were tasked to design a new IBM
   logo. Rand during this time, wrote the IBM usage manual, as
   this is a standard piece of literature for a logo of this scale
   and size for such a large corporation. He said:

     “The value of the logotype, which is the company’s signature
     cannot be overestimated.”

   The logo itself, didn’t take shape until many weeks after the
   task was given, development was progressive and well thought
   out. First Rand foresaw the need to maintain the branding and
   identity IBM had built up over many years by only making slight
   change to their existing logo. He changed the main font of the
   logo, from one called Beton to a more bold and intrusive
   typeface named City-BQ.

   Rand struggled with this change, he had full control of the
   project as the lead designer but felt uneasy about the current
   iteration of the design. He says:

     “I felt there was a problem with the sequence, going from
     narrow to wide without any pause, without any rhythmic
     possibility,”

   He was referring to the differences in weight and thickness of
   the letters IBM within the design he created, he strongly
   wanted to amend this. He experimented with logos for over a
   decade. But in 1972 he finally, with the help of advisors and
   professionals within the team. Changed the IBM logo to include
   lines horizontally placed but cutting out of the logo. To this
   day, it has remained unchanged and has stood the test of time.
   It’s arguably one of the best designed logos of all time.

   Rand’s design philosophy wasn’t purely design based. He wanted
   to absolutely make sure that the logo could fit and align with
   any sort of media. If that means either newspapers, IBM
   products like computers or circuit boards, magazines or even
   television commercials. Rand made sure to show this when
   proposing his design to the IBM executive. Showcasing the logo
   placed on IBM’s products and advertising. Today IBM’s current
   lead designer, who has taken over since Rand’s leave has since
   said:

     “You don’t throw away something that special very easily.”

   Even today, IBM has continued the style of Rand even after his
   passing. With colourful brochures and posters for analytical
   and statistical analysis. The brand of IBM is symbolic around
   the world as the architectures of mainstream computing and is
   well respected. They’ve recently created a video in memory of
   Rand and showcasing the work that was done.

   Rand was not just the architect for IBM's logo, but for many
   others such as NeXT's.

   NeXT was at the time an American software and computer producer
   co-founded by Apple’s Steve Jobs. He was the CEO and innovation
   behind Apple during its most innovative and lucrative years.
   Steve Jobs seen Rand as a genius, even labelling him as the
   “Greatest graphics designer of all time”. Jobs at the time
   didn't really convey much to Rand when meeting to discuss the
   logo, but simply “Wanted one”. Despite this, there was a
   certain sense of playfulness and energy that came out of that
   discussion as the two got along well together.

   Rand went away confident with many ideas, he first worked with
   basic concepts that contained remnants of his previous work.
   But this design was unique, similar to the IBM design. Step by
   step, Rand worked up an icon like logo which ultimately Steve
   Jobs had such a liking to when it was finally presented, he had
   it created and made into gifts for his staff and friends. Many
   designers past this time have looked back unto Rand’s work with
   NeXT’s CEO Steve Jobs and the NeXT company as a model for the
   creation of excellent branding.

   HIS
   FINAL
   DAYS

   As Rand grew older, he decided to pass some of his vast
   knowledge and expertise onto other students, by teaching at
   Yale University and cooper Union. He was always highly regarded
   in his teaching.

   Paul Rand eventually published a total of 19 distinct
   pieces/books over his lifetime, highest rated of which is
   titled “Thoughts On Design”. The book itself was written during
   the year 1947 and at the time Rand was 33 years old. He wanted
   to share his vision of modernism at the time and for the
   future. He wrote this book, about what he thought makes
   graphics design good, how it's useful and what makes beautiful.
   It features colourful and engaging illustrations and simple
   iconography. Since its publication, as with all his books, the
   lessons that can be learned from it are still relevant today.

   Another popular book from Paul Rand is the one named, “A
   Designer's Art”, it documented his process and experiences
   throughout his career. Most importantly it explained the theory
   and the mind behind Paul Rand and features more than two
   hundred illustrations throughout the book and at the time was
   considered a must read for graphics designers and still is
   today.

   Paul unfortunately lost a long battle to cancer during the year
   1996 at the age of 82. At his time of death, he was living and
   working in the state of Connecticut. During his last and final
   years he spent most of his time writing his memoirs. Which
   eventually paved the way for the vast legacy of Paul Rand.
