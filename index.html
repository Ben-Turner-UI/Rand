            WHO<br>
            WAS<br>
            PAUL<br>
            RAND?<br>
            </div>
                
                
            <p>Paul Rand, formerly <i>Peretz Rosenbaum</i>, is a self made designer and art director whom attended Harren High School during his teenage years, was a professor at Yale University and designed the ABC, IBM, NeXT and various other logos. He was mostly self taught through his own experience and ambition but during his years at High School he did take night classes to further progress himself. Rand’s origins can be traced back to the city of New York, where he was born during the year 1914. Even as a toddler Rand seemed to be well suited to art and visual design where he was able to express himself creatively.</p><br>

                <figcaption>Harren High School</figcaption></div>
                 
            <p>He did not begin down this career path reinvent graphics design, but instead wanted to be the best graphics designer there was. When he first entered High School he found the other students were intent on getting jobs that would net them a solid wage. Rand at the time was told by his father that making art was no way to make money. Despite this, he found some success in the field, as he managed to gain two High School diplomas. Despite being proud of his position and qualifications, he found school didn’t satisfy himself creatively. So he then went onto find work beyond education.</p><br>
                
                   <div class="centre"><img src="img/young.jpg" width="350" height="350"><figcaption>Paul Rand at his desk.</figcaption></div>
                 
            <p>
            With this he decided to change his image. Even his own name changed, with his original name Peretz Rosenbaum and then deciding to change it to “Paul Rand” - a far more recognizable and American name. Something he saw as necessary to progress himself as a brand and creative in the industry.
            </p><br>
                 
            <p>One of his first jobs and the start of his long lasting successful career began with the creation of stock images for various different types of media, like magazines and newspapers. He was given the work by some some well known media names at the time such as Direction and Esquire. Both of which are still published to this day and are magazines. Sometimes Rand even worked for free, just to get his name out there and to saturate his growing portfolio. When Rand was in his mid twenties, one of the leading arts magazines in America called Paul Rand one of the “most promising young influences on American graphics design”.</p><br>

            <p>Following this, one day he received a call from by a company called William H Wientruab. They gave him the opportunity to work with a big name copywriter Bill Bernbach and they would collaborate together and create for the company. Rand accepted this position and with Bill’s help Rand created adverts, with a minimal aesthetic and contained a strong and powerful message. </p><br>
                 
            <p>Rand said during this time that his first meeting with Bill Bernbach was  “akin to Columbus discovering America,” and goes on to say, “This was my first encounter with a copywriter who understood visual ideas and who didn’t come in with a yellow copy pad and a preconceived notion of what the layout should look like.”  Rand spent a total of 14 years in the company working for clients like, Airwick, Schenley and El Producto Cigars. In his later work his inspiration can be clearly seen coming from his work and experience at William H Wientruab. </p>

            THE<br>
            WORKS<br>
            </div>
        
        
           <p>Rand’s name was out, his brand was being talked about. He soon got the attention of big corporations, like IBM. IBM at this time was at the forefront of computing and technology and is still very relevant today. With this he was able to put together the final IBM logo, but not by himself. In the beginning, IBM created a team of top designers and thinkers, with Eero Saarinen leading the charge, he was considered at the time the godfather of modernism and co-creator the final logo. 
           </p><br>
        
            <div class="centre"><img src="img/OLDIBM.png" width="400" height="180"><figcaption>Pre-Rand Old IBM Logo</figcaption></div>

            <p>Charles and Ray Eames, two architectural and modernist designers and filmmakers. Their works include Day Of The Dead, St. Mary’s Catholic Church and various exhibitions, one of which was featured in the Library of Congress. Finally the last member of the team - Isamu Noguchi, a long time professional sculptor. Whom has had his work featured in various high level museums and art galleries. Together they represented the pinnacle of modern design and were tasked to design a new IBM logo. Rand during this time, wrote the IBM usage manual, as this is a standard piece of literature for a logo of this scale and size for such a large corporation. He said:</p><br><br>

            <blockquote><span class="quote2"><p>“The value of the logotype, which is the company’s signature cannot be overestimated.”</p><br><br></span></blockquote>

            <p>The logo itself, didn’t take shape until many weeks after the task was given, development was progressive and well thought out. First Rand foresaw the need to maintain the branding and identity IBM had built up over many years by only making slight change to their existing logo. He changed the main font of the logo, from one called Beton to a more bold and intrusive typeface named City-BQ.</p><br><br>
        
            <div class="centre"><img src="img/beton.png" width="500" height="50"><figcaption>Beton Font</figcaption></div>
        
            <div class="centre"><img src="img/city.png" width="500" height="50"><figcaption>City BQ Font</figcaption></div>

            <p>Rand struggled with this change, he had full control of the project as the lead designer but felt uneasy about the current iteration of the design. He says: </p><br><br>

            <blockquote><span class="quote2"><p>“I felt there was a problem with the sequence, going from narrow to wide without any pause, without any rhythmic possibility,”</p><br><br></span></blockquote>

            <p>He was referring to the differences in weight and thickness of the letters IBM within the design he created, he strongly wanted to amend this. He experimented with logos for over a decade. But in 1972 he finally, with the help of advisors and professionals within the team. Changed the IBM logo to include lines horizontally placed but cutting out of the logo. To this day, it has remained unchanged and has stood the test of time. It’s arguably one of the best designed logos of all time.</p><br><br>
        
            <div class="centre"><img src="img/IBM.png" width="400" height="140"><figcaption>Final IBM Logo</figcaption></div>

            <p>Rand’s design philosophy wasn’t purely design based. He wanted to absolutely make sure that the logo could fit and align with any sort of media. If that means either newspapers, IBM products like computers or circuit boards, magazines or even television commercials. Rand made sure to show this when proposing his design to the IBM executive. Showcasing the logo placed on IBM’s products and advertising. Today IBM’s current lead designer, who has taken over since Rand’s leave has since said: </p><br><br>

            <blockquote><span class="quote2"><p>“You don’t throw away something that special very easily.”</p><br><br></span></blockquote>

            <p>Even today, IBM has continued the style of Rand even after his passing. With colourful brochures and posters for analytical and statistical analysis. The brand of IBM is symbolic around the world as the architectures of mainstream computing and is well respected. They’ve recently created a video in memory of Rand and showcasing the work that was done.</p><br>
        
            <p>Rand was not just the architect for IBM's logo, but for many others such as NeXT's.</p><br>

            <p>NeXT was at the time an American software and computer producer co-founded by Apple’s Steve Jobs. He was the CEO and innovation behind Apple during its most innovative and lucrative years. Steve Jobs seen Rand as a genius, even labelling him as the “Greatest graphics designer of all time”. Jobs at the time didn't really convey much to Rand when meeting to discuss the logo, but simply “Wanted one”. Despite this, there was a certain sense of playfulness and energy that came out of that discussion as the two got along well together.</p><br>
        
            <div class="centre"><img src="img/steve.jpg" width="450" height="300"><figcaption>Steve Jobs Article, regarding his future and NeXT</figcaption></div>

            <p>Rand went away confident with many ideas, he first worked with basic concepts that contained remnants of his previous work. But this design was unique, similar to the IBM design. Step by step, Rand worked up an icon like logo which ultimately Steve Jobs had such a liking to when it was finally presented, he had it created and made into gifts for his staff and friends. Many designers past this time have looked back unto Rand’s work with NeXT’s CEO Steve Jobs and the NeXT company as a model for the creation of excellent branding.</p><br>

            HIS<br>
            FINAL<br>
            DAYS<br>
            </div>  
        
        <p>As Rand grew older, he decided to pass some of his vast knowledge and expertise onto other students, by teaching at Yale University and cooper Union. He was always highly regarded in his teaching.</p><br>

        <p>Paul Rand eventually published a total of 19 distinct pieces/books over his lifetime, highest rated of which is titled “Thoughts On Design”.  The book itself was written during the year 1947 and at the time Rand was 33 years old. He wanted to share his vision of modernism at the time and for the future. He wrote this book, about what he thought makes graphics design good, how it's useful and what makes beautiful. It features colourful and engaging illustrations and simple iconography. Since its publication, as with all his books, the lessons that can be learned from it are still relevant today.</p><br>

        <p>Another popular book from Paul Rand is the one named, “A Designer's Art”, it documented his process and experiences throughout his career. Most importantly it explained the theory and the mind behind Paul Rand and features more than two hundred illustrations throughout the book and at the time was considered a must read for graphics designers and still is today. </p><br>

        <p>Paul unfortunately lost a long battle to cancer during the year 1996 at the age of 82. At his time of death, he was living and working in the state of Connecticut. During his last and final years he spent most of his time writing his memoirs. Which eventually paved the way for the vast legacy of Paul Rand. </p>
